# Neural Network Fundamentals with Computer Vision
By David Gao

This is a repository containing a collection of my various projects regarding Neural Networks and Computer Vision, as well as an research documentation that details all of my learnings and takeaways in said subject.

Please begin reading by accessing the research document Jupyter notebook, which would act as a guide and more detailed description for the rest of the repository.

Note: As of 10/4/2024, some programs assumes that you have cuda (aka a NVIDIA GPU) on your device. I'll make all the programs adaptable to most hardware once I clean up some code.
